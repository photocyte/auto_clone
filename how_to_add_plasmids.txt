1)Add input checkbox under fileuploadform.html

e.g. 
<input type="radio" name="plasmid_name" value="pNew1">pNew1<br>

2)Add a text file to the ./plasmids directory, with the name of the file before the suffix equal to the value from the previous step

e.g.
pNew1.txt, with the following inside:

ForwardOverlap:GGGGGTTTTTAAACCCCC
ReverseOverlap:TTTTTTCCCCCAAAAGGGG
Comment:pNew1 Gibson primer for :

Don't screw up colons etc.

3)Thats the minimum needed. To have the script make the .gb plasmid files automatically, add a .gb file with several Ns to indicate where the insert should go

e.g. 

pNew1.gb, and inside it has capital Ns designating the insert:

attgtacgatcgatcgatcgNNNNNNNNNNNagctagctagctacgatcgatcgtacg

But actually in .gb (genbank) format.
